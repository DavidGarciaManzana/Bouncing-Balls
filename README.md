# Bouncing_Balls


A curious child was playing with his ball on a high floor of a tall building. He dropped the ball out the window and watched it bounce to a fraction of its height. His mother, sitting near a window on the ground, was curious about how many times the ball would pass in front of her window.

The child used math to create a function that calculated the number of times the ball would pass in front of his mother's window, considering the following:

 - The height of the floor must be positive.
 - The bounce fraction must be between 0 and 1.
 - The height of the mother's window must be lower than the height of the floor.

 Your task is to write the function that the child used to determine the number of times his mother would be able to see the ball pass by her window.
